# this is how we put "comments" or code that won't run when you execute the program
# if it's any color other than grey, it will run when you run the code.
# To run the code, click the menu in the top left corner then go run > run without debugging
# print hello world to the terminal
print("hello world")

# using the equals sign, we can put any value that we want into variable. 
# this a number aka integer
# all this is doing is storing the number for later use in our program aka referencing 
a_number = 10
# this is also a number but since it has a decimal point, we call it a float
a_float = 10.5
# If it is an integer, its just called an integer. If it has a decimal, then its called a float

# Since we put the numbers into variables, we can use them later in our program
# for example, here we can put that variable that we made on line 7 and 8 into the print command.
# guess what this will output
print(a_number) 
print(a_float)
